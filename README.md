# Mobedia Sassy

This is a decent baseline for an ITCSS style, sass project.

It includes a customizable bootstrap grid system and typebase.io for decent
default typography

Refer to the [Mobedia Style Guide](https://github.com/wearemobedia/style-guide)
for more about ITCSS and how it's used within Mobedia
